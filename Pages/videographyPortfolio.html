            This was the first short film I've ever made. I tried to capture the
            struggles of a bad relationship. It was a bit dark, but I still like
            how it turned out. I tried to use different camera angles, audio,
            color grading, and facial expressions to help me tell the story. I
            tried to use as little dialogue as possible. The only words uttered
            in the video was "bring my food to the living room, I'm hungry."
            Some feedback I've gotten was to not show the face of the guy to
            "vilify him" even more. That was definitely valid feedback that I
            plan to implement in the future.

            I was traveling to see family in the west coast and had a ton of
            footage and I wanted to see if I could condense it to a short travel
            video. This was the first travel video I've ever produced. Canon 80D
            was used as the main camera, GoPro Hero 6 was used for the under
            water shots, and the DJI Spark was the drone I choose for the aerial
            shots.

            A blast from the past, this was another travel video from my time in
            Mexico. In this video I was attempting to show the features of a
            popular Mexican park called Xcaret as well as practice my video
            skills. Canon 80D was used as the main camera and GoPro Hero 6 was
            used for the under water shots.

            A very happy birthday party. I was hired to take pictures and shoot
            a very short instagram video. There were a lot of happy moments to
            choose from. Canon 80D was used as the main camera and the DJI Spark
            was used to get the aerial shots. (Permission was granted from my
            client before posting this video.)
