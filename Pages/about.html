          Hi, My name is Mohamed A. Negm. I was born in Alexandria, Egypt on
          June 26th 1990. I migrated to the United States with my family on
          March 22nd, 2003. We've been living in Brooklyn, NY ever since. On
          arrival, I didn't speak much English and I didn't come with money. My
          parents worked tirelessly, day after day, to ensure that my siblings
          and I got an education. I'm now a NYC teacher, working with many
          students in the same cirmcumstances I found myself in. I earned my
          master’s degree and taught myself to code, the arts of photography,
          video creation and design.

          <h3>Animation</h3>
          A close friend approached me sometime in 2018 and asked me if I knew
          how to make animations. He explained that his organization was looking
          to hire an animation company to make a quick explainer video. I told
          him that I didn't know how to make animations but I'd try to see what
          I could do. I researched and taught myself enough about animation to
          make one quick explainer video about myself and my qualifications. He
          loved it! so did his boss. I kept teaching myself and kept learning.
          Take a look at my
          <a href="/Pages/animationPortfolio.html">animation portfolio</a> to
          see how far I've come!

          <h3>Web Developing</h3>
          I started out my college career with the intent of majoring in
          computer science. However, because I had to work full time I couldn't
          fully dedicate myself to my studies and ended up falling behind. Four
          years in, my advisor informed me that I would need at least another
          three years before graduating with my bachelor’s in computer science.
          I had to make a choice whether I stay the course or change my major to
          another degree that would allow me to graduate in just half that time.
          Desperate to graduate, I changed my major and earned a degree in
          political science. I was fortunate enough to get a job with my degree,
          enrolled and earned my master’s. However, I always kept coding in the
          back of my mind. This is the reason I started coding again. I kept
          learning, different technologies and kept coding. Four hours a day on
          top of my full time job and other family obligations. It wasn't for
          the intention to switch careers but because I felt I had failed myself
          earlier. As a working professional with a graduate degree, I didn't
          want to stop learning. This is where I stand today. Take a look at my
          <a href="/Pages/developerPortfolio.html">coding projects</a> to see
          how far I've come.

          <h3>Educator</h3>
          After I earned my undergraduate in political science, a logical next
          step was to look for work in my field of study. The only job I was
          able to earn was a paralegal in a foreclosure law firm. The pay was
          far from what I had expected, It was in fact $12 an hour. After 6
          years of college I was making less than what I was making working as a
          college student. One Saturday morning my wife said that she was going
          to apply to work in a school and recommended I'd apply along with her.
          My wife, an education major and I both applied, one short week later I
          received an email and she did not. The email was an invitation to an
          interview. I ended up getting the job. I quickly applied for my
          master’s in education and attended Relay Graduate School of Education
          for the next two years whilst working full time as a STEM teacher.
          I've now been working as an educator in an underserved school district
          since 2016. Although, it seems like I arrived to where I am with sheer
          luck, I had to work extremely hard to be where I am today. After
          teaching all day, I had to study and plan all night, just to be on the
          same level as other teachers. But I did it for my students. I am fully
          committed to equalizing the life opportunities of economically
          disadvantaged children relative to their more affluent peers by
          ensuring that our public schools provide an education that prepares
          children for success in the colleges and careers of their choice. Take

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          I've had a very weird relationship with photography for as far back as
          I can remember. I always found pictures fascinating. I remember always
          obsessing over every little detail in images as a young child. When it
          became "normal" to just take pictures on cellphones, I used that
          opportunity to document everything! It was AMAZING being able to zoom
          in using just my finger tips and looking at every detail. That was me
          for over a decade, until I was introduced to a DSLR. A friend of mine
          had one and let me borrow it for a trip I was going on to Philly. I
          absloutly fell in love. The fact that you can zoom in with a lens to
          take a picture without losing quality. The amount of details and
          colors had me in awe. When I got back I asked him to buy it and he
          agreed. Since that day, I've never left my house without a camera. In
          the beginning it was because I wanted to practice as much as I can.
          Then it was to a job. Finally, now It's for either or for my students
          (I teach the photography club at my school) Photography is my passion,
          I love making and seeing people smile; before, during and after their
          photo. Take a look at my

          <h3>Videography</h3>
          I learned almost everything I know about photography from YouTube. So,
          I thought why not give back to the community that has given me so
          much. I started making YouTube videos, I thought it would be an easy
          transition since I understood how exposure, lighting, and other
          photography related topics work. But it wasn't, there was much more to
          learn. Things like Frame Rates, Angles, B-Roll, audio, editing, and
          much more. I had to turn to youtube once more. I kept practicing and
          refining my skills, YouTube helped me tremendously. I had a 30 day
          challenge, where I'd record 30 videos in 30 days and edit them. The
          pressure was real, but so was the progress. I repeated this excersize
          3 more times with a small break in the middle. I taught myself to edit
          on Final Cut Pro X and Premiere Pro just to stay verstile. Now, I get
          hired for Events, Weddings, Lectures, and the likes. I also maintain a
          YouTube channel to keep my skills sharp. Take a look at my
